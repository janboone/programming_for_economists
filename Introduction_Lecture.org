* Introduction

** Don't panic

    - this is a programming course
    - we know that many of you are not too keen on computers (beyond MS Office)
    - this will be a gentle introduction to open source software
    - it will not become too sophisticated
    - it is meant for everyone to understand
    - especially, if you never did any programming before


** Why this course?

    - mainly to teach you to use your computer better
    - to be able to use open source ("free") software
    - to solve problems together with readable documentation on how you solved
      it ("reproducible research")
    - on this last point, office products like excel score rather badly
    - you will use R and python in courses in the years to come

** Who teaches this course?

+ In 2018-2019 this course is taught by:
  + Santiago Bohorquez Correa
  + Jan Boone
  + Mark Klik
  + Misja Mikkers
  + Marius-Lucian Prisacuta
  + Cheyenne Ramada


** How do we teach this course?

    - on line lectures on Datacamp
    - tutorials: with plenty of time to ask questions
      - there are a number of "regular" tutorials and one in the computer lab
      - if you do not have a laptop, attend the tutorial in the computer lab
      - if you do have a laptop, attend your regular tutorial group
      - no need to attend both!
      - we may drop some tutorial groups, so check Blackboard!
    - schedule can be found [[https://janboone.github.io/programming_for_economists/pages/schedule/][here]]
    - we can track your progress on datacamp
    - assignment notebooks to be made before the class
    - class notebooks that we do together in class (to allow you to ask questions)

** Information about the course

+ all information about the course can be found [[http://janboone.github.io/programming_for_economists/pages/][here]]
+ pay attention to:
  + [[https://janboone.github.io/programming_for_economists/pages/schedule/][the schedule]]: explaining when you need to do what
  + [[https://janboone.github.io/programming_for_economists/pages/exam/][the rules for the exam]] explaining how the exam works and a practice exam

** Your grade

There are two separate ways to earn your grade

+ regular route:
  + midterm on python
  + end of semester exam on R

+ resit
  + exam on python and R combined

You cannot use grades from one route for the other one.

** Exam

+ for more information see the [[https://janboone.github.io/programming_for_economists/pages/exam/][exam page]]
  + check the instructions for the exam
  + do not open your exam file after you have finished
  + if you do, your exam will not be graded (even if you did not change anything)

+ at the exam you can freely copy and paste from the assignments we did in class
+ we will not post answers to the assignments
+ make sure you attend the tutorials and pay attention in class!

** Datacamp

    - you need to sign up for Datacamp!
    - for details see [[http://janboone.github.io/programming_for_economists/pages/index.html][the heading Important]]
    - note the *deadline* for filling in the webform!
    - if you miss the deadline, you will have to pay for premium content on
      Datacamp yourself

** Github

- github allows you to store files "in the cloud"
- signing up for github is optional
- if you do sign up, you can ask us questions via the [[https://github.com/janboone/programming_for_economists/issues][issues page]] also during the exam

* markdown

** syntax

- markdown allows you to create structure in a simple way
- examples are:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    # this is a heading


    ## subheading


    * first bullet
    * second bullet

    [link text](actual link, e.g. http://www.etc)

    ![Alt text for image](/path/to/img.jpg "Optional title")
#+END_EXAMPLE

- look on the web for other syntax like footnotes etc.
- equations you can type in latex


** latex

- latex is great word processing software
- for now, we only need it to write math
- you can guess what the following will do:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
$x^2$, $\beta$, $\sqrt{9}$, $\frac{1}{2}$, $\bar x$

\begin{equation}

a^2 + b^2 = c^2

\end{equation}
#+END_EXAMPLE

- if you need something, just google; e.g. "google latex phi" or
  "google latex empty set" etc.
- and try it out in the jupyter notebook


* Second part of lecture

** go to the server and start a jupyter notebook

+ [[https://janboone.github.io/programming_for_economists/pages/][link to the server]]
+ address to copy/paste in the google form
+ importing the python material
+ (this is also the way you will import your exam)
+ evaluating cells
+ you can choose python/R kernel
+ getting help: ? and TAB
+ code vs. markdown cell
+ type some latex

** before you leave

  - do the steps under [[http://janboone.github.io/programming_for_economists/pages/index.html][the heading Important]]
